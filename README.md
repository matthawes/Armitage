## Description

This project was created at the request of Mr. Armitage, who owns an accounting firm in the US. The purpose is to create a place for owners & managers of restaurants to login, enter data such as cash flow, employer information, etc while also seeing financial data from the accountant.

He had designs, prototypes and a database created previously, but needed a web developer to create a functioning web application. I was able to implement the functionality using PHP and MySQL, and the design using mostly Bootstrap. It took me 3 weeks to complete, including time for hiccups with security features. The owner decided for the time being, a user can not self-register and must instead request access in which an administrator will administer. I also used Google's reCaptcha API for added security.

## Technologies Used:

- PHP
- MySQL
- MAMP
- Bootstrap
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript
